## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of JavaScript
- Node.js installed (v18 or higher recommended)
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/prashantmore45/Typescript-zero-to-advanced-Tutorial.git
cd Typescript-zero-to-advanced-Tutorial
```

2. Navigate to any lesson folder:
```bash
cd lesson-01-start-here
```

3. Install dependencies (if package.json exists):
```bash
npm install
```

4. Run the TypeScript compiler or development server as specified in each lesson.

## 📖 How to Use This Repository

Each lesson is self-contained in its own directory with:
- Source code examples in the `src` folder
- TypeScript configuration (`tsconfig.json`)
- Relevant dependencies and build scripts

**Recommended Approach:**
1. Start from Lesson 01 and progress sequentially
2. Read the code and comments in each lesson
3. Experiment by modifying the examples
4. Complete any exercises before moving to the next lesson

## ⚙️ Configuration

Each lesson includes a carefully configured `tsconfig.json` with:
- Strict type checking enabled
- Modern ES2020/ES2022 target
- Appropriate compiler options for learning
- Domain-specific configurations (React, Vite, etc.)

## 📝 Key Features

- ✅ Progressive difficulty curve
- ✅ Practical, real-world examples
- ✅ Modern TypeScript best practices
- ✅ Integration with popular frameworks (React, Vite)
- ✅ Strict type checking enabled for better learning
- ✅ Ready-to-run code examples
